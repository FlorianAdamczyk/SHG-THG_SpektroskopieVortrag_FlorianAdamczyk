    prompt       = {Cinematic shot, 1961 University of Michigan Physics Laboratory -- Nighttime. Moody, atmospheric lighting dominated by the intense, coherent crimson beam of an early ruby laser (694 nm) cutting dramatically through the dim lab air, illuminating swirling dust motes. The thick red light beam strikes a small, precisely mounted, faceted quartz crystal at the center of the frame. Emanating from the back of the crystal, piercing the smoky darkness, is a second, distinct, ethereal beam of brilliant violet-blue light (347 nm UV, artistically represented as visible violet). Dr. Peter Franken (mid-30s, intense focus, slight stubble, wearing a rumpled lab coat, horn-rimmed glasses) leans in close, eyes wide with dawning realization and awe, illuminated by the dual glow. His hand hovers near the crystal, almost trembling. On the lab bench: vintage oscilloscopes with glowing green CRTs, chunky analog dials, scattered schematics, a coffee-stained notebook, and a sheet of graph paper fluorescing brightly where the violet beam strikes it. In the background: bulky brass-and-steel laser components, heavy electrical transformers, chalkboard dense with complex equations partially erased. Style: Hyper-detailed, Kodachrome film grain texture, shallow depth of field focusing on the crystal and dual beams. Lighting: High contrast -- deep shadows punctuated by the laser's ruby red and the shocking, unexpected violet emission. Mood: Tense, electric, momentous scientific discovery. Aspect Ratio: 16:9.},
